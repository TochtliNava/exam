Some say the end is near
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon
I certainly hope we will
I sure could use a vacation from this bull-shit
Three ring circus, side-show of freaks
Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away
Any fucking time, any fucking day
Learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay
